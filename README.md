This Program is designed to download, parse and depict
an .xlsx file that can be found by the address: https://bdu.fstec.ru/files/documents/thrlist.xlsx
The program is also able to find and display differences between a current version of a file and the one
that user downloads by pressing the button "Download/Redresh".
The program is still unfinished as it has some serious disadvantages.
